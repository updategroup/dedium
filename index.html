<h1 style="text-align: center">Dedum Decentralized Computing on Cardano</h1>
<p style="font-size: 30px">Dedium's versatile GPU resources find
applications in various sectors, including
artificial intelligence (AI) training, machine
learning (ML), 3D rendering, scientific
computing, and more. An example of
Dedium's capabilities is demonstrated by
Instacart, which utilized parallel computing
capabilities via Ray, the framework that
Dedium will employ. The result was up to
100 times more data processed [2],
achieving speeds 12 times faster than
traditional methods [3], while significantly
reducing operational costs. This example
highlights Dedium's potential to
revolutionize industries by democratizing
access to GPU power and driving
innovation and efficiency..</p>

    The network consists of distributed nodes,
representing users eager to utilize their idle
GPUs to earn DEDI tokens or commercial
nodes. Through our software, these nodes
are interconnected via peer-to-peer
communication protocols, to dictate and
exchange information.
The Dredium platform is responsible for
overseeing the client requirements and
connecting them with the right nodes. To
determine the right node and allocate the
task the network looks for the requirements
of the client and uses a sophisticated
mechanism called proof of history to
choose which nodes to allocate the task.
When pricing is requested, the network
employs a dynamic pricing model that
consults the smart contract and available
nodes to provide a quote.
